![lattix, puzzle solving made beautiful](static/lattix-banner.png)

---

***lattix*** is a UI for solving puzzles of any kind. You know what I’m talking about – Sudokus, [Skyscrapers](https://sup2point0.github.io/skyscraping), [Jane Street puzzles<sup>↗</sup>](), anything that uses a grid.

Solving puzzles with pen and paper is an experience, but sometimes you just need a digital version where you can easily edit bits, make temporary notes and undo mistakes. *lattix* is just that – it doesn’t load or solve puzzles, it’s just a tool for working out your solution.

## Future Features

- Ctrl+Z to undo
